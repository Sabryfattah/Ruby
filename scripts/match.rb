Features:
*List all your spending in one file, each item on a line, separated by commas
*Date, Venue, Category, Amount
*Caregories : Shopping, Food, Clothing, Home, Health, Outing, Bills
*Get a list of selected category saved into a file named (original-list_category.txt)
*Get the sum total of amount spent, appended to the end of that category list file
*Get a list of spending in a month saved to a file (original-list_month)
*Add the totals of each of the 12 months to get the annual spending

Script Steps:
1- read a file lines into an array 
2- search each line for regex matching pattern
3- list all lines which contain such pattern 
(with pattern highlighted between <>)
4- user to enter the name of file as first argument ARGV[0]
and pattern as second argument ARGV[1]
5- write all these pattern matching lines into a file with name of "pattern_rex.txt"
6- Append the sum total of amount spent to the end of the output file.

Usage:
search_file4 <original-list.txt> <category or month or regex pattern>

Output:
Files named original-list_category or original-list_month, (e.g. spent_march.txt)

Other uses:
1- Search a long list of database for items sharing the same pattern.
      e.g. Names of contacts living in the same city.
2- Search a long web page for ip addresses: http://
3- Search a number of files for lines containing a Regex pattern and save ouput to a file.
4- Sum any field containing amount of money in comma separated lines of data
5- Replacement for Excel sheets, manipulation of data in fields of lines in text file
6- Search a file for a pattern using commandline arguments (filename, search pattern)
